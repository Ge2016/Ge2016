ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I name is Ge Xiong. Here on my GitHub, I try to showcase my work and progress in learning the different progamming language such as C, Java, Python, etc. I am interested in learning more about machine-language in general. I enjoy progamming simple applications, such as games, on my spare time. This is a way to introduce myself to different platforms and learn about the different machine-language. I also have a website and in my blogs, I introduced videos of my coding projects, images of my success, and my findings on computer science topics. 

You can reach me at ge.xiong.jobs@gmail.com or visit my website for my blogs @gexiongblog.wordpress.com, computersecuritystudies.wordpress.com
